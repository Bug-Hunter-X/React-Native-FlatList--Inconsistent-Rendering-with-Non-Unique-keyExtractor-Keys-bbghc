This error occurs when using the `FlatList` component in React Native and setting the `keyExtractor` prop to a function that doesn't return a unique key for each item.  This leads to inconsistent rendering and performance issues. For example, if your data array contains objects with non-unique IDs, the `FlatList` might reuse the wrong components, leading to incorrect display or unexpected behavior.  Consider the case where you have an array of objects like this: `[{id: 1, name: 'Item 1'}, {id: 2, name: 'Item 2'}, {id: 1, name: 'Item 3'}]`. Using `(item) => item.id` as the `keyExtractor` will cause problems because `id:1` is not unique.
