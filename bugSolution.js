To fix this, ensure each item in your data array has a unique identifier, and your `keyExtractor` uses that unique identifier.  One approach is to use a UUID library or generate UUIDs when creating your data objects.

Here's how to implement the fix using the `uuid` library:

```javascript
import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid';

const data = [
  { id: uuidv4(), name: 'Item 1' },
  { id: uuidv4(), name: 'Item 2' },
  { id: uuidv4(), name: 'Item 3' },
];

// ... in your FlatList component
<FlatList
  data={data}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <Text>{item.name}</Text>}
/>
```

If you can't modify your data structure, you could construct a unique key from multiple fields within your `keyExtractor` function, but that is less ideal than having a dedicated unique id on your data model.
